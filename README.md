# BA-RSA

This project has been developed to investigate the performance of RSA on sorting algorithms as stated in the paper "Can RSA understand Sorting Algorithms?". 
It is a parallelized version. In main.py the simulation parameters e.g. array size and iterations can be set and which method (Linear Sum Assignment or Dynamic Time Warping) to find mappings between intermediate states of each sorting algorithm to use. 
The results of the simulation will be logged to a log file, sample log files are available or can be directly plotted after each iteration. 

In order to execute this the only sotware and libraries needed are python 3.7, scipy 1.7.3 and numpy 1.21.5.
